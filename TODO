Come up with some sort of canonical row id
 - if data keeps updating, pandas row ids aren't exactly stable
 - it's somewhat crazy that crsid is not unique
   - * try to understand why there are duplicate crsids
 - could maybe build an ID out of other columns
   - and just excluding based on project id shouldn't do too much harm?

Look at SQL/NoSQL databases with some sort of *indexing*
 - not sure what will have best performance

Formalize the setup process
 - script that downloads the files via wget/curl/etc
 - puts them in some sort of versioned directory
 - unzips them, converts to strip redundant BOMs etc
 - concatenates into a master file

Split utils into a bunch of more focused files:
 - downloading/converting raw OECD data
 - preparing postgres tables
