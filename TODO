Look at using PyTables/HDF5 to store data
 - may be necessary due to large data size if we end up hosting on a modest (i.e. affordable) Amazon instance

Also look at SQL/NoSQL databases with some sort of indexing
 - not sure what will have best performance

Add ability to delete queries?

Formalize the setup process
 - script that downloads the files via wget/curl/etc
 - puts them in some sort of versioned directory
 - unzips them, converts to strip redundant BOMs etc
 - concatenates into a master file

Lock down Django
 - toggle debug to false
 - externalize secret key
 - add authentication/login, maybe permissions?
