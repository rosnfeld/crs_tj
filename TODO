Formalize the setup process
 - script that downloads the files via wget/curl/etc
 - puts them in some sort of versioned directory
 - unzips them, converts to strip redundant BOMs etc
 - concatenates into a master file

Look at using PyTables/HDF5 to store data
 - may be necessary due to large data size if we end up hosting on a modest (i.e. affordable) Amazon instance
